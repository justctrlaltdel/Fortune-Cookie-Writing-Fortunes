# Fortune-Cookie-Writing-Fortunes

The goal of Fortune Cookie Writing Project is to generate text and numbers randomly just like a fortune cookie. 

Using the 'if' function. 

I also used the following commands –

fortune_text = '' – to insert my fortune text.

lucky_number = random.randint(1,100) – to randomly generate a number no higher than 100, and no lower than 1. 

See Example:

if fortune_number == 1:
  fortune_text = 'Everything you wish for you shall recieve'

if fortune_number == 2:
  fortune_text = 'Smile you never know who needs it.'

if fortune_number == 3:
  fortune_text = 'Buy two scratch offs you might just win.. one of these days'
  
  print(f'{fortune_text} Your Lucky Number is: {lucky_number}')
